## INTRODUCTION
**Dogs vs. Cats** [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) provided by  Microsoft Research contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats with the labels 
* 1 = dog
* 0 = cat 

### Building Deep Neural Network from scratch

### *This project explores the applicability of deep neural network by tunning these hyperparameters:*
1. Learning rate
2. Number of hidden layers
3. Number of nodes in each hiden layers
4. Number of iterations



## MODEL PERFORMANCE

## CONCLUSION
The current literature suggests machine classifiers can score above [80% accuracy](chrome-extension://cbnaodkpfinfiipjblikofhlhlcickei/src/pdfviewer/web/viewer.html?file=http://xenon.stanford.edu/~pgolle/papers/dogcat.pdf) on this task.
We successfully achieved the accuracy of % with these detailed hyperparameters:
